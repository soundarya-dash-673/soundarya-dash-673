# AI Automation Portfolio

A collection of enterprise-grade AI systems designed to bridge the gap between design, documentation, and technical execution.

## 🤖 AI-Powered JIRA Automation System

**Bridging Figma Designs to Development Backlogs**

This system utilizes a multi-agent orchestration layer to transform visual design assets into actionable developer documentation.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Orchestration:** LangGraph, LangChain
* **LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4
* **Languages & Cloud:** Python, AWS Lambda
* **Integrations:** JIRA REST API, Figma API

### 🚀 Key Features

* **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Specialized agents for Design Component Extraction, User Flow Analysis, and Acceptance Criteria (AC) Generation.
* **Automated Requirement Extraction:** Achieved **85% accuracy** in translating Figma frames into technical user stories via advanced prompt engineering.
* **Bidirectional Sync:** Real-time consistency using JIRA webhooks and Figma plugins; updates in the design automatically trigger updates in the corresponding JIRA story.
